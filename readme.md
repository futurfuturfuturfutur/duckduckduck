Laravel package able to auto generate API documentation through tests, without garbage comments inside the code base.

## Support of documentations
1. OpenAPI 3.0.0

## How it works
If your project has excellent feature testing coverage, it means you already has documentation for this project. You've 
already described available paths, requests body, parameters, content types, response payloads and http codes. You shouldn't 
describe it again by your own just in format of the api documentation you use.The package principle is super simple: when you run tests,
package middleware just grab response and request of the test case and saves it as an api documentation config file, which 
you can use to render.

## Install
1. Install package with `composer require --dev futurfuturfuturfutur/duckduckduck`
2. Publish and setup package with `php artisan duckduckduck:init`. This command will publish duckduckduck.php configuration 
file inside the ```config``` folder of Laravel with base configuration of your API documentation and create ```/duckduckduck``` 
package dir inside the root of the app to contain all documentation configs of your project generated by package.
3. Add TestCase trait inside the phpunit TestCase 
    ``` php
    <?php
    
    namespace Tests;
    
    use Futurfuturfuturfutur\Duckduckduck\Traits\DuckduckduckTestCase;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase as BaseTestCase;
    
    abstract class TestCase extends BaseTestCase
    {
        use CreatesApplication;
        use DuckduckduckTestCase;
        ...
    }
    ```

## Usage
### Setup
The package will handle most of the things, but some of them you need to define by yourself:
1. Define base info of the API documentation (name, description, type of documentation, version) inside the `config/duckduckduck.php`
1. Route description and group should be defined as PHPDoc comment of the class of the test (All of them are optional):
    ``` php
    /**
     * @DuckDuckDuckRouteGroup Group name
     * @DuckDuckDuckRouteDescription Description
     */
   class IndexTest extends TestCase
   {
    ```
1. A test case description should be defined as PHPDoc comment of the case method:
    ``` php
    /**
     * @DuckDuckDuckRouteDescription Description of the case
     */
    public function testShow()
    {
    ```
### Run build
Run your tests in API documentation generation mode with `php artisan duckduckduck:generate`. The package will run feature tests pf your app 
and generate documentation file inside the package ```/duckduckduck``` dir inside the root of the app.

### Run documentation render with Docker
The easiest and prettiest way to run your documentation render server to just up the docker container with ```/duckduckduck``` 
package directory passed inside.

#### Swagger
``` shell script
docker run -p 9999:8080 -e SWAGGER_JSON=/duckduckduck/swagger.json -v /duckduckduck:/duckduckduck swaggerapi/swagger-ui
```
*Remember that mounting duckduckduck folder should be defined as absolute path*
 
### API documentation

 - [x] Path, query and body parameters from request
 - [x] Responses for the route with payloads and codes
